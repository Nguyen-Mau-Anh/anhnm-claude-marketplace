## Breadth-First Layering

Use when: Topic has many interconnected concepts that need a mental map first.

### Process

1. **Layer 0 — Map**: List all major concepts/components as a visual map (bullet tree or diagram)
2. **Layer 1 — One-liner**: Explain each concept in one sentence, no jargon
3. **Layer 2 — Mechanics**: Explain HOW each concept works, introduce terminology
4. **Layer 3 — Connections**: Show how concepts relate, depend on, or interact with each other
5. **Layer 4 — Edge cases**: Cover exceptions, trade-offs, and "when NOT to use"

Between each layer, ask: "Which of these concepts feels least clear? Let's go deeper there."

### Example prompts between layers

- "Before we go deeper — in your own words, how do X and Y relate?"
- "Rate your confidence on each concept: 1 (foggy) to 5 (could teach it)"
- "Which concept surprised you or contradicted what you expected?"

## Socratic Dialogue

Use when: Learner has some foundation and needs to deepen understanding through reasoning.

### Process

1. Start with a provocative or non-obvious question about the topic
2. Let the learner reason through it
3. Ask follow-up questions that expose gaps or push toward deeper insight
4. Only provide direct answers after the learner has attempted reasoning
5. Summarize the insight discovered through dialogue

### Question types (in escalating difficulty)

- **Clarification**: "What do you mean by X?" / "Can you rephrase that?"
- **Assumption-probing**: "What are you assuming here?" / "What if that wasn't true?"
- **Evidence-seeking**: "How do you know that?" / "What would prove you wrong?"
- **Implication-exploring**: "If that's true, what follows?" / "How does this affect Y?"
- **Perspective-shifting**: "How would someone who disagrees see this?" / "What's the opposite approach?"

### Anti-patterns to avoid

- Asking questions you immediately answer yourself (defeats the purpose)
- Making questions so hard the learner shuts down — calibrate to their level
- Leading questions that have only one "correct" answer (genuine inquiry only)

## Explain-Back Method

Use when: Testing whether understanding is genuine vs. surface-level pattern matching.

### Process

1. Present a concept or mechanism
2. Ask the learner to explain it back as if teaching someone else
3. Listen for: accuracy, completeness, correct use of terminology, logical flow
4. Identify specific gaps: "You covered X well, but didn't mention Y — what role does Y play?"
5. Have them re-explain the corrected version

### Evaluation criteria

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Uses correct terminology naturally | Deep understanding |
| Explains with analogies | Good conceptual grasp |
| Can only repeat what was said | Surface-level, needs more work |
| Identifies own uncertainty | Self-aware, guide to fill gaps |
| Can generate new examples | Strong transfer understanding |

### Variations

- **Teach to a 5-year-old**: Forces simplification, reveals whether they grasp the core
- **Teach to a peer**: Tests technical accuracy and completeness
- **Teach by analogy**: Tests conceptual transfer ability
- **Debug the explanation**: Give a subtly wrong explanation, ask them to find the error

## Technique Selection Guide

| Situation | Primary technique | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Brand new topic, many concepts | Breadth-First Layering | Need mental map before depth |
| Learner has some background | Socratic Dialogue | Build on existing foundation |
| After teaching a concept | Explain-Back | Verify genuine understanding |
| Learner is confident but may have gaps | Explain-Back + Socratic | Expose hidden misunderstandings |
| Complex system with interactions | Breadth-First → Socratic | Map first, then reason about connections |

**General rule**: Cycle between techniques. Use Breadth-First to introduce, Socratic to deepen, Explain-Back to verify. Repeat at increasing depth.

## Difficulty Calibration

Continuously assess the learner's level and adjust:

### Signals the learner is struggling

- Long pauses or vague answers
- Repeating back without adding insight
- Asking for definitions of basic terms
- Expressing frustration

**Response**: Slow down. Use simpler analogies. Break concept into smaller pieces. Use more Breadth-First layering.

### Signals the learner is coasting

- Quick, confident but shallow answers
- Not asking questions
- Wanting to skip ahead

**Response**: Challenge with Socratic questions. Ask for edge cases. Present counter-examples. Use Explain-Back to test depth.

### Signals the learner is in flow

- Asking unprompted questions
- Making connections you didn't suggest
- Generating their own examples
- Expressing excitement about implications

**Response**: Follow their curiosity. Accelerate. Move toward Implementation phase sooner.
